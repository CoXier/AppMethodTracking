# Method Tracking
A plugin to display how methods are called in application.

[Live Demo](http://coxier.cn/AppMethodTracking.html)

# Usage

## Stpe1
Add these to your root `build.gradle`.

```groovy
buildscript {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
    }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath "gradle.plugin.com.uniquestudio:method-tracking:1.0.6"
  }
}

```
Don't forget :

```groovy
apply plugin: "com.uniquestudio.method-tracking"
```

## Step2
First find where you want to debug.In my demo I care about how to wear cloth,so I add two lines around `wearCloth` like this:

```groovy
Debug.startMethodTracing(getPackageName());
wearCloth();
Debug.stopMethodTracing();

public void wearCloth() {
    putOnCoat();
    putOnPants();
    putOnShoes();
    putOnHat();
}


private void putOnPants() {

}

private void putOnCoat() {

}

private void putOnHat() {
    // Put on hat
}


public void putOnShoes() {
    putOnSocks();
    // Put on shoes
}

public void putOnSocks() {
    // Put on socks
}
```
## Step3
Now let's start configure this plugin.In your app module, add `method-tracking` closure.

```groovy
methodTracking{
    traceName = 'com.hackerli.sample.trace'
    filterList = ['com.hackerli.sample']
}
```
* `traceName` is from the method `Debug.startMethodTracing(traceName)`
* `filterList` is used to filter some extra methods.We usually use package name.

## Step4
```groovy
./gradlew track
```
After above steps,`traceName.html` is created.

Its output like this:

<img src="/screenshot/s_0.png"/>

The digit is `useces`.


In html,I add click event that means you can toggle these elements that have children.For example if I click `com.hackerli.sample.MainActivity.putOnShoes` above line,I will get:

<img src="/screenshot/s_1.png"/>
